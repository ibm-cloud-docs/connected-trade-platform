## Executive Summary
{: #executive-summary}

Trade Finance represents financial products and services that facilitate domestic and international trade activities between buyers and sellers aiming to mitigate performance and payment risks while improving cash flows. This is a global industry with a diverse ecosystem of participants such as:

- Buyers
- Suppliers
- Logistics and Financial Providers
- Government Entities dealing with tax collection, border security and regulatory aspects
- International organizations such as
    - WCO
    - ICC
    - UN

The diagram below captures the trade finance ecosystem participants

A trade transaction requires a seller of goods and services as well as a buyer. Various intermediaries such as banks and financial institutions can facilitate these transactions by financing the trade. Trade finance manifests itself in the form of letters of credit (LOC), guarantees, or insurance, and is usually provided by intermediaries

But this is a very fragmented and distributed ecosystem where technology adoption has been lagging in comparison with other industries.

## Trade Finance Market

The global trade finance market size was evaluated at $10.52 trillion in 2023 and is slated to hit $13.66 trillion by the end of 2032 with a CAGR of nearly 2.94% between 2024 and 2032.

## Trade Finance Challenges and Opportunities
{: #trade-finance-challenges-opportunities}

Today, we are seeing significant digital disruption in the business of trade and supply chain financing that is largely influenced by global events and geopolitics, changing regulations, compliance and control requirements, advancements in technology and innovation, and access to capital.

When examining these disruptors more closely, it’s clear there are a wide variety of factors that can impact global trade and supply chain financing. These can range all the way from elevated inflation (which has the potential to cause margin pressures) to geopolitics (which can impact globalization and force changes towards friend shoring) and near shoring. At the same time, complex and fragmented supply chains can introduce challenges like supply chain compliance and fraud mitigation. Supplier visibility and traceability is growing in importance to help achieve environmental, social and governance (ESG) targets.

Lets take a deeper look at some of the friction points

- Setup And Documentation
    - Unpredictable mix of manual and machine documents 
    - Varying documents and formats 
    - Exception processing is labor-driven
- Credit Analysis
    - Errors due to manual workflow data completeness, and data inaccuracy
    - Due to above, bank foregoes funding credit-worthy suppliers 
- Commercial & compliance checks
    - Research and verification of documents is time-consuming 
    - Forgery and fraud risks are difficult to eliminate 

- Transaction Processing
    - Inefficiency from re-keying data to gain multiple bank departmental approvals
    
- Fulfillment
    - Manual processes and fragmented systems increase time, coordination, and cost in releasing funds 
    
- Post-fulfilLment
    - Lack of data to support regulatory reporting, tracking, discrepancy analysis 


These are just a few of the many key factors we see driving transformational change within trade and supply chain processes.

### Transitioning from a fragmented to a data-driven supply chain
{: #data-driven-supply-chain}
{: #subheading}

In the past, we have traditionally seen manual, paper-intensive trade processes that have the potential to generate large amounts of data. However, this data can often become trapped in silos and cause complexities, resulting in delays and increased costs. With the increasing demands of global trade, organizations are starting to embrace digitization, standardization and collaboration to accelerate time to value and reduce costs.

Technology is playing an important role in reprogramming the DNA of trade and supply chain financing. It can help connect disparate and disconnected manual processes and platforms to a data-driven and connected trade ecosystem. Siloed processes can become integrated by using intelligent workflows, which help enable seamless and automated exchange of financial, informational and physical supply chain data in one distributed network.

With these capabilities, a single source of truth can then be established across all parties, helping to increase trust between trading parties. This approach can provide users with new and more efficient ways of conducting and financing global trade.

## Proposed Solution: IBM Connected Trade Platform
{: #proposed-solution-ctp}

Digitization—along with standardization and collaboration within the industry—can help create a variety of benefits. For example, banks gain real-time visibility into their respective supply chains, eliminate paper-based processes and associated manual labor, improve speed to working capital optimization, enhance cash-flow forecasting accuracy, safeguard transactions against cybersecurity risk, enable greater supply chain resiliency and unlock wider procure-to-pay benefits.

At IBM, we recognize that this transformation will require adopting a platform strategy that lifts the supporting ecosystem, and we aim to deliver this using next-generation ‘as a Service’ business models.

As organizations look to modernize their trade finance journeys, we have leveraged the breadth of IBM’s technology and consulting capabilities to develop a Connected Trade Platform for the industry.

As part of our approach, we are sourcing digitally native business-process capabilities from multiple fintechs, given that no two banks are likely going to going to have the same set of applications or processes.

Our platform strategy is designed to build secured infrastructure that is optimized for regulated business processes and help support clients in their compliance journeys. It is also abstracted at a common infrastructure control plane that aims to make it easy for banks to adopt and consume. With a plug-and-play integration framework for banking-specific backend systems, the platform can help enable the flow of financial transactions from the front office to the back office.

At IBM, we believe it’s critical that this industry-specific platform is optimized to enable growth and de-risk trade for all the participants in the ecosystem:

- **From a bank’s perspective**, this can mean reduced time to market, elimination of fragmented and manual processes, and conformity to an individual bank’s security and compliance standards.
- **From a buyer’s perspective**, it can drive significant improvement in working capital, superior supplier performance and accelerated ESG initiatives.
- **From a fintech's perspective**, it can reduce the barrier to adoption, enable an expanded go-to-market reach, deliver flexible integration with a bank’s backend systems and allow for simplified operations management of their respective applications.
